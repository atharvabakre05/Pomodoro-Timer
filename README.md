# Pomodoro-Timer
It's a traditional technique to foucs on a particular work for 25 minutes (An adequate span of human to focus). It also include a short 5 minutes gap after a each session! One can use this technique to increase his efficiency and productivity. I used HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript to build this project!
